    <p>     Coming from a background where I have no prior knowledge in coding. Code Nation caught my attention for the simple fact they can take you 
        from zero knowledge in Coding to a junior developer in 12 weeks. I'm leaving a career in the Military which is daunting to say the least code nation 
        makes you feel at home and the instructors are of top quality.
