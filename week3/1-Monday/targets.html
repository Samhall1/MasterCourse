     <dd>I initially started teaching myself basic JavaScript but was struggling to understand how the basics are implemented in a website, the first week of the course 
         taught me why and where these basics can be implemented. Confirmation for me was conducting challenges in week 2 where I put in to practice 
         everything I had been taught.
